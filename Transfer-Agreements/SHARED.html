		<h3>DCCC students can complete programs of study not offered by the college at area community colleges that do offer them. Prerequisite courses are taken at DCCC. Students benefit by paying the in-county tuition rate for attending a community college outside of their county of residence. They will earn the associate degree or certificate from the partner community college upon successful completion of the program.</h3>
